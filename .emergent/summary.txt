**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Frontend:** React,  for API calls,  for state management.
- **Backend:** FastAPI, Pydantic for data modeling, Motor for async MongoDB operations.
- **Database:** MongoDB.
- **Email:** Python's  for sending emails via Gmail's SMTP server.
- **Styling:** TailwindCSS with custom CSS for animations and overrides.

**key DB schema**
- **demo_requests**: 

**changes in tech stack**
None.

**All files of reference**
- : Main React component for the entire landing page, including form submission logic.
- : FastAPI application defining API endpoints for demo requests and integrating the email service.
- : Contains the function to send email notifications via Gmail SMTP.
- : Contains custom styles, animations for the success message, and the override to hide the Made with Emergent badge.
- : Stores confidential credentials for MongoDB and Gmail.
- : The main HTML file, modified to change the page title and remove branding.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- The Made with Emergent badge is hidden via a CSS  rule. A cleaner long-term solution would be to definitively prevent the script from loading or executing.
- The  file still contains several sections of placeholder data that should be either removed or replaced with real content.

**key api endpoints**
- : Creates a new demo request, saves it to the database, and triggers an email notification.
- : Retrieves a list of all submitted demo requests.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- The email notification system relies on user-provided Gmail credentials ( and ) stored in . If email sending fails, the first debugging step is to verify these credentials with the user.
- The Made with Emergent badge was forcefully hidden with CSS in . Be aware of this if any global style changes are made.

**documents created in this job**
- : Defines the API contract for the demo request feature.

**Last 10 User Messages and any pending user messages**
1.  **User:** Provided new app password and Gmail address for notifications.
2.  **User:** Confirmed email receipt but requested a more creative frontend success message.
3.  **Agent:** Implemented the animated success message.
4.  **User:** Requested a deployment readiness check.
5.  **Agent:** Performed the check and confirmed readiness.
6.  **User:** Asked to remove the Made with Emergent tag.
7.  **Agent:** Found and attempted to remove the tag via HTML/JS removal.
8.  **Agent:** When the tag persisted, applied a CSS  fix.
9.  **Agent:** Confirmed the fix with a screenshot.
10. **Pending:** User needs to verify the badge removal on their end.

**Project Health Check:**
- **Working:** The application is fully functional. Frontend, backend, database, and email notifications are all working correctly.
- **Mocked:** No parts of the final user-facing application are mocked. Some placeholder data remains in  but is not currently displayed.

**3rd Party Integrations**
- **Gmail SMTP** — used for sending email notifications. Requires User API Key (App Password).

**Testing status**
- Testing agent used after significant changes: NO
- Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop: NO
- Test files created: []
- Known regressions: []

**Credentials to test flow:**
The following credentials are required and are stored in :
- : 
- : 

**What agent forgot to execute**
The agent successfully identified that placeholder data for Problem Statistics, Features, and Workflow Steps still exists in . The user was informed but did not provide updates for this data, so it remains as-is. This is not an oversight but rather a task pending further user input.</analysis>
